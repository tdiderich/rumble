2. offline_assets_all_time - sum of the `change.offlineAssets` value in the scan stats 
3. scan_count - total number of scans run by the task 
4. average_assets_seen - average number of assets found in the scan (new or existing)
5. max_assets_seen - most assets found in a single scan with this task 
6. min_assets_seen - leas assets found in a single scan with this task
